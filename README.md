# 🔢 Number System Converter  

A simple **HTML & CSS** project built for my **first-year maths module**.  
It allows users to **convert between various number systems** including:  

- 🧮 **Binary ↔ Decimal**  
- 🧩 **Decimal ↔ Hexadecimal**  
- 💡 **Hexadecimal ↔ Binary**  

This was one of the **first working web projects I ever created**, and I’ve kept it here for **educational purposes** as a reminder of where I started.  

> ⚠️ The code in this repository is **not representative of my current ability** — it’s an early step in my learning journey please ignore the 100 or so if statments 😅.

and how simple logic can be represented visually with clean web design.
